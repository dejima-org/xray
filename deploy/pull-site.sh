#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs on the web host (see dejima-xray-pull.service). Finds the newest
# successful deploy.yml run for a push to main, downloads its `site` artifact,
# unpacks it as a new release and atomically points `current` at it. Does
# nothing if that build is already live.
#
# Only a push to main can produce a deployable build: the forge, not the
# workflow, sets a run's branch and event, so a workflow on another branch
# cannot pass itself off as one.
#
#   SITE_FORGE_API  the forge's API root, e.g. https://gitbox.branderson.io/api/v1
#   SITE_REPO       owner/repo
#   SITE_ROOT       directory holding releases/ and the `current` symlink
#   SITE_KEEP       releases to keep for rollback (default 5)
#
# The forge token is read from $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/token (systemd
# LoadCredential), never from the environment or argv.
